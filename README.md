 Two models: picture and user. The relation among these two is that user creates pictures,

## Data storage.

 The test code has managed the creation, population and destruction of all tables/collections.
 The database is locally set, so MongooDB should be started before testing (just start, no need
 to create anything).

 CollectionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
         category: String,
         name: String,
         size: Number,
         follow: Number
     },
     { collection: 'collections' });

 PictureSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
         collectionid: {type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'collection'},
         name: String,
         describe: {type: String, default: null},
         comment: []
     },
     {collection: 'pictures'});

 UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
         name: {type: String, required: true},
         password: {type: String, required: true},
         email: {type: String, unique: true},
         collectionid: [{type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, unique: true, ref: 'collection'}],
         fans: [{type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, unique: true}],
         follows: [{type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, unique: true}]
     },
     {collection: 'users'});

## Extra features.

 There are three test files for each route. The relation among the three should be tested as well. For example,
 as the collection is deleted, all the pictures in this collection should also be deleted, so I test whether the
 pictures is removed from the database. Besides, each user have follows and fans, which means if user1 follow user2
 (user1 follow + 1), and user2 will have a new fan who is user1 (user2 fan + 1), I just test whether the ids are really
 added to both lists.
